// Add more informations to the topHourlyStats, so I will have more things to add into homepage. For channels add streaming game and stream title. For games add streaming channels

// GAME PAGE
// while getting page get information from API about certain game.
// Games API https://www.igdb.com/games/league-of-legends - use this to get informations for game page
// Maybe save actual streaming channels into db, and use this to show on page here. Use dummy data for this maybe, because its a lot of data to be stored.
// Use above data to create some kind of big chart on page, which will show streaming channels/total views corelation
